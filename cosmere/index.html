        <h3>Who is Brandon Sanderson?</h3>
        <p>
          Brandon Sanderson is a best-selling fantasy author. He “was born in
          December 1975 in Lincoln, Nebraska”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">1</a></sup
          >and has since written many fantastic novels. Among them are
          <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>, <i>The Mistborn Saga</i>,
          <i>Elantris</i>, <i>Warbreaker</i>, <i>White Sand</i>, <i>Skyward</i>,
          <i>The Reckoners</i>, <i>Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians</i>,

            ><a href="bibliography.html">2</a></sup
          >
          He also assisted in writing the <i>Wheel of Time</i> series. As part
          of his writing, he created what is known as the Cosmere, in which many
          of his books take place.

        <h3>What is the Cosmere?</h3>
        <p>
          “The Cosmere is the fictional universe [Brandon Sanderson] created for
          many of [his] fantasy novels to take place within. Currently
          <i>Elantris</i>, <i>Mistborn</i>, <i>Warbreaker</i>,
          <i>The Stormlight Archive</i>, <i>White Sand</i>, and anything from
          <i>Arcanum Unbounded</i> are part of the Cosmere.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">3</a></sup
          >
          All the worlds in the Cosmere “share a single creation myth, a single
          cosmology, that gives underlying theorem of magic for all these
          connected worlds.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">3</a></sup>
          In the rest of this website I will describe the different worlds in
          the Cosmere, what books they come from, and the magics that permeate
          them.
