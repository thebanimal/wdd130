      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>For my website I would like to focus on Brandon Sanderson’s Cosmere. He is my favorite author and in his multitude of books, he has created a universe in which all of his books are connected, the Cosmere. On the first page of the website, I will give a brief overview of what the Cosmere is and who Brandon Sanderson is. On the second page I will list each of the books he has written that fit into the Cosmere and a brief description of how they fit in. Finally, on the last page, I will explain some of the magics that permeate the Cosmere and how they fit in with the Cosmere as a whole.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be people who are interested in the author Brandon Sanderson. It will be for those with little knowledge of his Cosmere and want to know more.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Who is Brandon Sanderson?<br>
	Brandon Sanderson is a best-selling fantasy author. He “was born in December 1975 in Lincoln, Nebraska”1 and has since written many fantastic novels. Among them are The Stormlight Archive, The Mistborn Saga, Elantris, Warbreaker, White Sand, Skyward, The Reckoners, Alcatraz vs the Evil Librarians, The Rithmatist, and Infinity Blade.2 He also assisted in writing the Wheel of Time series. As part of his writing, he created what is known as the Cosmere, in which many of his books take place.<br>
What is the Cosmere?<br>
	“The Cosmere is the fictional universe [Brandon Sanderson] created for many of [his] fantasy novels to take place within. Currently Elantris, Mistborn, Warbreaker, The Stormlight Archive, White Sand, and anything from Arcanum Unbounded are part of the Cosmere.”3 All the worlds in the Cosmere “share a single creation myth, a single cosmology, that gives underlying theorem of magic for all these connected worlds.”3 In the rest of this website I will describe the different worlds in the Cosmere, what books they come from, and the magics that permeate them.

        Spoilers Ahead!<br>
Yolen<br>
	Yolen is the base of measurement for other planets in the Cosmere, “being exactly at 1.0 Cosmere standard”4 in size and gravitation.<br>
The Selish System – Elantris and The Emperor’s Soul<br>
	Elantris and The Emperor’s Soul both take place on the planet of Sel. There are multiple empires who tend to be “somewhat ignorant of one another.”4 It is a large planet (1.5 Comere standard) with a lot of variation in landscape. There is a single sun, Masha, and “a number of other planets,”4 but none of them are of particular importance.<br>
The Scadrian System – Mistborn<br>
	The Mistborn Saga takes place on the planet of Scadrial. For the most part, Scadrial is alone in its solar system and is 1.0 Cosmere Standard. The people of Scadrial are more technologically advanced compared to other planets in the Cosmere. Due to some events in its past, Scadrial has moved at various points in its history.<br>
The Taldain System – White Sand<br>
	White Sand takes place on the planet of Taldain. “Taldain is a tidally locked planet trapped between the gravitational forces of two stars.”4 The two stars differ greatly in size, one being a white dwarf and the other being a super-giant. Due to the difference in size and intensity of its suns, Taldain has a perpetual “Darkside” and a “Dayside.” “Darkside is more hospitable and varied,”4 while Dayside is, for the most part, a vast desert.<br>
The Threnodite System – Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell<br>
	Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell takes place on the planet of Threnody. It is the third planet in its solar system and contains two continents. “The larger of the two has been abandoned to something called ‘the Evil.’”4 The second is sparsely populated by small pockets of people in forts or various outposts.<br>
The Drominad System – Sixth of the Dusk<br>
	Sixth of the Dusk takes place on the planet called “First of the Sun,” so named because it is the closest planet to its sun in the system. There are also 3 other planets, 2 of which are also “inhabited by fully developed human societies.”4 “All 4 of these planets have water as a dominant feature.”4<br>
The Rosharan System – The Stormlight Archive<br>
	The Stormlight Archive takes place on the planet of Roshar, which sits at “0.7 Cosmere standard in gravitation and 0.9 in size.”4 There are also 2 other planets in this system, all of which support life in some form. There are “a series of enormous gas giants”4 on the edges of the system. Roshar has a single main continent, also named Roshar, which is populated by a diverse ecosystem. The planet is also regularly ravaged by massive and intense storms.

Investiture<br>
	“Investiture is the guiding principle behind all of the magic systems within the Cosmere,”5 and as such, can be found on every world of the Cosmere (so far). “When a person is Invested, they’re actively tapping into their planet or realm’s specific form of magic and channeling it.”5 <br>
