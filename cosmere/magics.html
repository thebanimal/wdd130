        <p>
          Allomancy is the first of 3 known magic systems on Scadrial, the world
          of the <i>Mistborn Series</i>. This power requires a person to ingest
          “different metals and metabolizing (‘burning’) them to achieve various
          effects.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup> There are two
          main types of Allomancers, Mistings and Mistborn. “Mistings are those
          who can only metabolize one metal and therefore access a single power
          of Allomancy, whereas a Mistborn is one who can metabolize all sixteen
          metals and their alloys to gain access to the full range of allomantic
          abilities.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup>

        <h3>Aon Dor – <i>Elantris</i></h3>
        <p>
          Aon Dor, also called just the Dor, is one of the main magic systems
          used on Sel, the world on which <i>Elantris</i> takes place. “The Dor
          is a massive realm of power hidden from the world which can only be
          accessed through various linguistic devices and forms, and/or specific
          movement or shapes.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup> Those
          “Invested with a connection to the Dor”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup
          >
          are able to draw Aons, symbols which the people of Sel use as their
          written language, in the air, creating a variety of effects based on
          what they write and how they write it. Others “practice specific
          martial arts, whose forms satisfy something in the Dor.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup
          >
          There is even “a group of monks in the mountains [that] actually grow
          their bones into specific shapes, tapping into the Dor through the
          twisted symbols within their own bodies.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup

        <h3>Forgery – <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i></h3>
        <p>
          Forgery, which also takes place on Sel, is the main form of magic in
          <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i>. “A different means to access the Dor,
          Forgery is all about rewriting the history of an object, and then
          using linguistic shapes in the form of Soulstamps to activate those
          rewrites.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup> Special
          Soulstamps, called Essence Marks, “allow the forger to change their
          own history, rewriting it to give themselves specific abilities,
          skills, information, and so on.”<sup

        <h3>Surgebinding – <i>The Stormlight Archive</i></h3>
        <p>
          Surgbinding is one of the “many, many different magic systems
          operating”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup> on Roshar, the
          world on which <i>The Stormlight Archive</i> takes place. “On Roshar…
          there are ten fundamental forces of the universe, and these are known
          as surges. A Surgebinder can access two of these surges each through
          the bond they develop with a spren, a sentient force of life or
          emotion. The spren helps them tap into the Investiture of the planet,
          a substance known as Stormlight.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup
          >
          To use these surges, “the surgebinder inhales and holds onto the
          Stormlight, and uses it as fuel to for their abilities.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">5</a></sup
          >
        </p>
        <p>The ten types of surgebinders and the surges they use are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Windrunners – Adhesion and Gravitation</li>
          <li>Skybreakers – Gravitation and Division</li>
          <li>Dustbringers – Division and Abrasion</li>
          <li>Edgedancers – Abrasion and Progression</li>
          <li>Truthwatchers – Progression and Illumination</li>
          <li>Lightweavers – Illumination and Transformation</li>
          <li>Elsecallers – Transformation and Transportation</li>
          <li>Willshapers – Transportation and Cohesion</li>
          <li>Stonewards – Cohesion and Tension</li>
          <li>Bondsmiths – Tension and Adhesion</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sand Mastery – <i>White Sand</i></h3>
        <p>
          Sand mastery is the main magic system on Taldain, the world on which
          <i>White Sand</i> takes place. “Sand mastery makes use of the white
          sand found on Taldain's Dayside.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">13</a></sup
          >
          “It involves manipulation of white sand at the cost of the user's
          internal water supply. In addition, white sand that has been
          manipulated will turn black, becoming unresponsive,”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">13</a></sup
          >
          signaling that it has been drained of its Investiture. “Black sand
          turns white again after four hours of sun exposure.”<sup

        </p>
        <h3>Aviar – <i>Sixth of the Dusk</i></h3>
        <p>
          Aviar are special birds on First of the Sun, the planet on which
          <i>Sixth of the Dusk</i> takes place. “Most Aviar are relatively large
          birds, approximately three fists tall.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">6</a></sup
          >
          “Aviar are more intelligent than ordinary animals. Wild Aviar exhibit
          behaviors similar to other birds.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">6</a></sup
          >
          “Juvenile birds can gain magical powers, or "talents", by consuming
          special [Invested] worms.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">6</a></sup>
          Not many of these talents are known, but “the power obtained by Aviar
          is different for each species of bird.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">6</a></sup
          >
          “Aviar are able to share their powers with humans through a Spiritual
          Connection.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">6</a></sup> Two of the
          known abilities are the “ability to conceal their mental activity and
          those of others around them”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">6</a></sup
          >
          and the ability “to glimpse into the future… [seeing] potential deaths
          of a person, and [manifesting] these potential deaths as visions of
          corpses wherever they could be killed.”<sup

        <h3>Shades - <i>Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell</i></h3>
        <p>
          Shades are “Spirits of dead Threnodites,”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">7</a></sup
          >
          residents of the planet Threnody, the planet on which
          <i>Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell</i> takes place. “The
          shades haunt the Forests preying on travelers and can only be defeated
          with silver. The shades are dangerous and feared by all inhabitants of
          the Forests, as their touch can cripple and disfigure and may even
          kill a person and turn them into a shade.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">7</a></sup
          >
          The Threnodites made “the Simple Rules” to avoid attracting shades.
          The Simple Rules forbid the lighting any kind of fire,”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">7</a></sup
          >
          the drawing of blood, and “moving quickly at night.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">7</a></sup
          >
          “Violation of the Simple Rules is the only known way to cause a Shade
          to enrage.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">7</a></sup> “Shades are
          almost entirely incorporeal, able to pass through solid substances
          like walls. The most dangerous of a shade's ability is its touch. A
          touch from a shade withers and blackens flesh, causing it to pull in
          towards the bone.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">7</a></sup> “The
          withering touch of a shade can only be reversed in a few specific
          ways. Application of silver powder may reverse a person's withering,
          either by application to the affected area or swallowing the powder
          itself.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">7</a></sup> “Shades can also
          be wounded with weapons made silver”<sup
