            This page describes the worlds of the Cosmere. If you want to read
            about these worlds without any spoilers, please do not keep reading.
            I encourage you to read the books yourself first. If you have
            already read the books, or wish to continue anyway, enjoy!

        <h3>Yolen</h3>
        <p>
          Yolen is the base of measurement for other planets in the Cosmere,
          “being exactly at 1.0 Cosmere standard”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup
          >
          in size and gravitation.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Selish System – <i>Elantris</i> and <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <i>Elantris</i> and <i>The Emperor’s Soul</i> both take place on the
          planet of Sel. There are multiple empires on Sel who tend to be
          “somewhat ignorant of one another.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup
          >
          It is a large planet (1.5 Comere standard) with a lot of variation in
          landscape. There is a single sun and “a number of other planets,”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup
          >
          but none of them are of particular importance.
        </p>
        <h3>The Scadrian System – <i>Mistborn</i></h3>
        <p>
          The <i>Mistborn Saga</i> takes place on the planet of Scadrial. For
          the most part, Scadrial is alone in its solar system and is 1.0
          Cosmere Standard. The people of Scadrial are more technologically
          advanced compared to other planets in the Cosmere. Due to some events
          in its past, Scadrial has moved at various points in its history.
        </p>
        <h3>The Taldain System – <i>White Sand</i></h3>
        <p>
          <i>White Sand</i> takes place on the planet of Taldain. “Taldain is a
          tidally locked planet trapped between the gravitational forces of two
          stars.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup> The two stars
          differ greatly in size, one being a white dwarf and the other being a
          super-giant. Due to the difference in size and intensity of its suns,
          Taldain has a perpetual “Darkside” and a “Dayside.” “Darkside is more
          hospitable and varied,”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup>
          while Dayside is, for the most part, a vast desert.
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Threnodite System –
          <i>Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell</i>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <i>Shadows for Silence in the Forests of Hell</i> takes place on the
          planet of Threnody. It is the third planet in its solar system and
          contains two continents. “The larger of the two has been abandoned to
          something called ‘the Evil.’”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup
          >
          The second is sparsely populated by small pockets of people in forts
          or various outposts.
        </p>
        <h3>The Drominad System – <i>Sixth of the Dusk</i></h3>
        <p>
          <i>Sixth of the Dusk</i> takes place on the planet called “First of
          the Sun,” so named because it is the closest planet to its sun in the
          system. There are also 3 other planets, 2 of which are also “inhabited
          by fully developed human societies.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup
          >
          “All 4 of these planets have water as a dominant feature.”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup
          >
        </p>
        <h3>The Rosharan System – <i>The Stormlight Archive</i></h3>
        <p>
          <i>The Stormlight Archive</i> takes place on the planet of Roshar,
          which sits at “0.7 Cosmere standard in gravitation and 0.9 in
          size.”<sup><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup> There are also 2
          other planets in this system, all of which support life in some form.
          There are “a series of enormous gas giants”<sup
            ><a href="bibliography.html">4</a></sup
          >
          on the edges of the system. Roshar has a single main continent, also
          named Roshar, which is populated by a diverse ecosystem. The planet is
          also regularly ravaged by massive and intense storms.
